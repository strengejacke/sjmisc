Description: Collection of miscellaneous utility functions (especially intended
    for people coming from other statistical software packages like 'SPSS', and/
    or who are new to R), supporting following common tasks when working with
    data : 1) Reading and writing data between R and other statistical software
    packages like 'SPSS', 'SAS' or 'Stata' and working with labelled data; this
    includes easy ways to get and set label attributes, to convert labelled
    vectors into factors (and vice versa), or to deal with multiple declared
    missing values etc. 2) Data transformation tasks like recoding,
    dichotomizing or grouping variables, setting and replacing missing values.
    The data transformation functions also support labelled data.
