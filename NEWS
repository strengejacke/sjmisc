Version 1.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "is_crossed" to check whether two factors are crossed.
* "is_nested" to check whether two factors are nested.

Changes to functions:
* "std_beta" now accepts plm-objects.
* "to_value" now auto-detects lowest minimum value of numeric factors, instead of always setting minimum value to 1.

Bug fixes:
* "std_beta" did not work in some cases - fixed.
* "mwu" did not accept factors as grouping levels - fixed.
* "mwu" did not work when value range of "grp" vector was not continuously - fixed.
* "cv" did not work with lme-objects (from nlme-package) - fixed.
* "cramer", "phi" and "table_values" did not work with tables of class "xtabs" - fixed.
* "to_value" (resp. "set_val_labels") did not work in certain situations when factor had not continuously numeric levels - fixed.


Version 1.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* First release of this package - it contains all utility, recode and statistical test functions from the "sjPlot" package.

New functions:
* "rec" to recode variables.
* "cv" to compute coefficient of variance.
* "rmse" to compute root-mean-square error.

Changes to former sjPlot-functions:
* Improved internal management of imported data via "haven" and "foreign" packages, so users don't need to care of structure and classed of data read with either haven, foreign or sjPlot's read-functions.
