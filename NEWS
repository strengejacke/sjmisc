Version 1.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "icc" to compute intraclass-correlations for random-intercepts of mixed models.
* "hoslem_gof" to perform a Hosmer-Lemeshow-Goodness-of-Fit-test for logistic regression models.
* "cod" to compute the Coefficient of Discrimination, aka Tjur's Pseudo-R2, for logistic regression models.
* "pseudo_r2" to compute the Nagelkerke's and Cox-Snell's Pseudo-R2 for logistic regression models.

Changes to functions:
* Functions "std_beta" and "cv" now support "merModLmerTest" objects (fitted by `lmerTest` package).
* "mean_n" has a "digit" parameter to round returned mean values.
* "rec" and "recode_to" now also accept data frames as parameter.
* "chisq_gof" now accepts "glm"-objects, however, computing the Chi-squared-Goodness-of-Fit-test for logistic regression models sometime may fail.

Bug fixes:
* "set_na" did not work with logical vectors - fixed.
* "recode_to" did not work when "var" had value-label-attributes - fixed.

Version 1.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "is_crossed" to check whether two factors are crossed.
* "is_nested" to check whether two factors are nested.
* "is_num_fac" to check whether a factor has only numeric levels.

Changes to functions:
* "std_beta" now accepts plm-objects.
* "to_value" now auto-detects lowest minimum value of numeric factors, instead of always setting minimum value to 1.
* "set_na", "dicho", "to_fac", "to_value" and "to_label" now also accept data frames as parameter.

Bug fixes:
* "std_beta" did not work in some cases - fixed.
* "mwu" did not accept factors as grouping levels - fixed.
* "mwu" did not work when value range of "grp" vector was not continuously - fixed.
* "cv" did not work with lme-objects (from nlme-package) - fixed.
* "cramer", "phi" and "table_values" did not work with tables of class "xtabs" - fixed.
* "to_value" (resp. "set_val_labels") did not work in certain situations when factor had not continuously numeric levels - fixed.


Version 1.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* First release of this package - it contains all utility, recode and statistical test functions from the "sjPlot" package.

New functions:
* "rec" to recode variables.
* "cv" to compute coefficient of variance.
* "rmse" to compute root-mean-square error.

Changes to former sjPlot-functions:
* Improved internal management of imported data via "haven" and "foreign" packages, so users don't need to care of structure and classed of data read with either haven, foreign or sjPlot's read-functions.
